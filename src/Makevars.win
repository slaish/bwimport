## src/Makevars.win  â€” Windows: build from vendored sources, link curl+zlib

# Include our headers in src/
PKG_CPPFLAGS += -I.
 
# Let R compile the .c files present in src/ (bwRead.c, bwStats.c, bwValues.c, bwWrite.c, io.c)
# Nothing special to list: R compiles all .c/.cpp into .o automatically.
 
# Link the Windows libcurl and zlib (ucrt64)
# These flags will be finalized by configure.win (below) if pkg-config is available.
